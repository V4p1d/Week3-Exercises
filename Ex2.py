# Write a program that receives an input string from the user. 
# If the length of the string is even and larger than 6, the program prints "The input is long and even!". 
# If the length of the string is even and smaller or equal than 6, the program prints "The input is short and even!". 
# If the string is odd, the program prints "The input is odd and I don't care how long it is!"
